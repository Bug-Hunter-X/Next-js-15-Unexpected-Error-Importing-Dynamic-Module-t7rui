# Next.js 15 Dynamic Import Error

This repository demonstrates a common error encountered in Next.js 15 applications when using dynamic imports within page components. The error arises from improper handling of dynamic modules, leading to unexpected behavior or crashes during rendering.

## Issue Description
The `pages/about.js` file attempts to dynamically import a component (`./my-component`). If this import fails (e.g., the component doesn't exist or there's a problem during the import process), Next.js 15 may throw an error, interrupting the page rendering.

## Reproduction Steps
1. Clone the repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
3. Run `npm run dev` to start the development server.
4. Navigate to `/about`.

You will likely encounter an error message related to the dynamic import failure.

## Solution
The solution involves implementing proper error handling for the dynamic import using the `next/dynamic` component, incorporating error handling and fallback components.
